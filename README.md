# X-Ray Image Recognition of Pneumonia Based on Machine Learning
The project is to predict normal and pneumonia by training AI models to recognize X-ray images of the lungs.This project focuses on learning how to use AI and exploring the differences between the ResNet model and the CNN model.

# Datasets resource
https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/rscbjbr9sj/2

The data set is structured as follows:

  chest_xary-------------------------
  
      test----------------------------
          NORMAL----------------
          PNEUMONIA-----------
      train------------------
          NORMAL----------------
          PNEUMONIA-----------
      val-----------------------------
          NORMAL----------------
          PNEUMONIA-----------
  111

Because the data set is too large to upload, please download the data set through this link and put it in accordance with this structure. The uploaded file contains only a few images for the test run after downloading, and cannot be used as formal training.

# Running
After the decompression is complete, ensure that all files are in the same directory. 

Run **pip install -r requirements.txt** on the terminal. 

If you're not using a 30-series or 40-series graphics card, change the version of Pytorch as needed.

**train.py** is used to train the model.

**evaluate_model.py** is used to evaluate the model on test set. 

**test_model.py** randomly selects 10 images from the test set for visualization.

# Results

The best training results are stored in the compare_7 folder and the results are as follows.

|Model|Accuracy|Recall|F1 Score|
|-----|--------|------|--------|
|CNN|77.88%|71.20%|72.41%|
|ResNet-50|87.50%|87.50%|87.30%|
